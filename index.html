          <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

          <p>
            This Personal Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by
            an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. It uses four
            rings with the following semantics:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high
              confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale.
              Technologies with a usage culture in our production environment,
              low risk and recommended to be widely used.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work
              with success in project work to solve a real problem; first
              serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
              limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some
              engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
              knowledge and experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising
              and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to
              invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has
              impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often
              brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find
              some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote
              it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping
              effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be
              used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet)
              worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used
              for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing
              projects.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams to
            pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform
            to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on
            technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology
            landscape. Based on the
            <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar"
              >pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a
            >, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are
            interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think
            our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their
            projects.
          </p>

          <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is supposed to be maintained by group of
            <em>Principal Engineers</em> &mdash; who facilitate and drive the
            technology selection discussions across the Engineering Community.
            Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change
            proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open
            for contribution for all Engineering teams and depends on their
            active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and
            contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br />
